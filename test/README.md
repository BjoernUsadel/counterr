# Unit tests
A collection of unit tests used to aid development and debugging. To run the tests, call the following command in the root directory.
```
python -m unittest discover
```

Rather than feeding in real data examples, the test scripts generate and test routines on mock data. This makes it easier to record the true answer while generating the data.
